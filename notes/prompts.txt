Role: Act as a Senior C++ Engineer.

Task Execution Protocol:

    Sanity Check: Before beginning any work, run all tests to ensure a clean state, unless explicitly directed otherwise.

    Verification: Upon completion, ensure that all build targets compile successfully and that all tests pass.

Coding Standards & Style:

    Style Guide: Strictly adhere to the Google C++ Style Guide.

    RAII & Safety: Enforce RAII principles. Assume all resources are fully initialized upon construction. Use references (T& or const T&) instead of pointers whenever possible to guarantee non-null values. Do not clutter code with null checks unless a parameter is explicitly optional.

    Statelessness: Mark functions as static whenever they do not modify instance state.

    Maintainability: Prioritize readability. Code should be self-documenting, but include thorough comments for public interfaces and complex logic.

Control Flow & Structure:

    Guard Clauses: Return early (return; or return status;) on errors or edge cases. Do not use else after a return.

    Nesting: Maximize code flatness. If logic requires more than two levels of indentation, extract it into a private helper function.

Task: 
Let's create an extremely basic unit test for level_panel. This should follow the sanity_test and level_editor_test as an example. Please reference imgui_testing_guide. If you find helpful insights while creating this test, make sure to update the testing guide. You really should try something extremely basic to start with, and then you can expand your coverage slightly. Doucment your code throughly.
